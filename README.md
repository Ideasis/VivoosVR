Project files excluding Unreal 4 source engine codes

VivoosVR is a virtual treatment tool to assist in exposure therapy where participants are placed in a computer-generated 3D virtual world and guided through the selected environments, situations and conditions. 

Physiological values of the participants are constantly monitored via GSR and pulse sensors. The system is designed to be used by qualified therapists and our target participants are young people suffering from phobias and social anxiety. 

Simulation worlds have been created using Unreal 4 game engine and we support popular VR HMDs such as Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. 
We also have plans to optimize the system for mobile VR solutions in the near future. 

VivoosVR is being developed in cooperation with a team of psychology / psychiatry experts.  

VivoosVR is composed of 2 applications: 

1-) .NET Application which is considered as the UI of the project. Through this application, user is able to create, control and review sessions. Source code of the .NET Application can be accessed through this [link](https://github.com/Ideasis/VivoosVR/tree/master/UserInterface/LocalVersion/VivoosVR).

2-) Unreal Engine 4 Build which includes the 3D simulated worlds where the users face their specific fears. Conditions and events in the UE4 environments are controlled through .NET Application. Links to latest version of these UE4 Builds can be accessed through this [link](https://github.com/Ideasis/VivoosVR/blob/master/UE4%20Project%20Scenarios/README). If you wish to take part in development of these scenarios, you can contact us at iletisim@ideasis.com.tr
