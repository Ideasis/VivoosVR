VivoosVR is a virtual treatment tool to assist in exposure therapy where participants are placed in a computer-generated 3D virtual world and guided through the selected environments, situations and conditions. 

Physiological values of the participants are constantly monitored via GSR and pulse sensors. The system is designed to be used by qualified therapists and our target participants are young people suffering from phobias and social anxiety. 

Simulation worlds have been created using Unreal 4 game engine and we support popular VR HMDs such as Oculus Rift and HTC Vive. 
We also have plans to optimize the system for mobile VR solutions in the near future. 

VivoosVR is being developed in cooperation with a team of psychology / psychiatry experts.
